Undocumented features in ProTracker (up to 2.3D):

1) PT2.2A and newer:
   Type "lock" on the keyboard to lock PT, it asks for a password up to 8 chars
   (press ENTER for a password less than 8 chars), then PT is locked until you
   type the password again. This locks mouse/keyboard input.

2) PT2.1A and newer (removed in PT2.3E):
   Type "noxious" on keyboard, it will show "not implemented".
   Was probably meant to show an easter egg or some info..?

3) PT2.2A and newer:
   Press both left and right mouse buttons on the little dot next to the
   Disk Op. path gadget. This will list all available disk drives and let
   you select one of them.
	 
4) PT2.1A and newer:
   Press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + LEFT-AMIGA + DEL.
   Prepares a pattern for the infamous "backwards play" trick by inverting data.

5) PT1.0B and newer:
   Press the empty button next to the <> key.
   Kills all playing voices!
